# azure-learning-notes
Hi ðŸ‘‹,  

Iâ€™m Harini Priya, an **Azure learner** exploring the world of cloud computing.  
This repository is my personal **learning journey**, where I document everything I study about Azure â€” from the very basics to advanced services.  

Think of it as my **cloud diary** âœ¨.  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Why this repo?
- To track my **progress** while learning Azure.  
- To create a **knowledge base** I can revisit anytime.  
- To **share** my learnings with others who are on the same path.

Hope this will be useful
