# azure-learning-notes
Hi 👋,  

I’m Harini Priya, an **Azure learner** exploring the world of cloud computing.  
This repository is my personal **learning journey**, where I document everything I study about Azure — from the very basics to advanced services.  

Think of it as my **cloud diary** ✨.  

---

## 🌟 Why this repo?
- To track my **progress** while learning Azure.   
- To **share** my learnings with others who are on the same path.

💡 *If you’re also learning Azure, feel free to use these notes or suggest improvements.*  
Let’s learn and grow together 🌍
