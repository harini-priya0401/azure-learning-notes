Recently, I created an Azure Virtual Machine and deployed Jenkins on it.
Here’s what I did:
•	Provisioned a Linux VM in Azure
•	Connected via SSH
•	Installed & configured Jenkins
•	Allowed inbound access to Jenkins UI on port 8080 
This Demo helped me get hands-on with Azure VMs, Jenkins, and Linux basics.
