Recently, I created an Azure Virtual Machine and deployed Jenkins on it.  
Hereâ€™s what I did:

- Provisioned a Linux VM in Azure  
- Connected via SSH  
- Installed & configured Jenkins  
- Allowed inbound access to Jenkins UI on port 8080  

This demo helped me get hands-on with **Azure VMs, Jenkins, and Linux basics**.
