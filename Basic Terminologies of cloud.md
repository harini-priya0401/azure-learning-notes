☁️ Cloud

Cloud computing means using data center of cloud providers to store, run, and manage your applications and services over the internet, instead of relying only on your own physical servers.

🔹 Types of Cloud

Public Cloud – Services offered over the internet by providers like Azure, AWS, GCP. Shared by many customers. (Ex: Azure VM)

Private Cloud – Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, managed internally or by a vendor. (Ex: Company’s own datacenter cloud setup)

Hybrid Cloud – Combination of Public + Private clouds, connected securely to share data/applications. (Ex: Banking apps that use private cloud for sensitive data and public cloud for customer portals)

🖥️ Server

A server is a powerful computer that provides resources, data, or services (like websites, databases, apps) to other computers (clients).

🌀 Virtualization

Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server by using software called a hypervisor. This increases efficiency and reduces cost.

🏢 Data Center

A data center is a large facility that houses servers, storage, and networking equipment. Cloud providers like Microsoft and Amazon have global datacenters.

📍 Availability Zone (AZ)

An AZ is a physically separate datacenter within a cloud region, with independent power, cooling, and networking. Designed for fault tolerance.

🌍 Region

A region is a geographical area (like "East US", "Central India") containing multiple availability zones. Choosing the right region reduces latency and ensures compliance with local regulations.

📈 Scalability

The ability of a system to increase or decrease resources (like CPU, memory, servers) as demand changes.

Vertical scaling – upgrading the server (add more CPU/RAM).

Horizontal scaling – adding more servers.

🔄 Elasticity

Elasticity is automatic scaling – resources are added or removed dynamically based on demand. Example: E-commerce app scaling up during festive sales and scaling down afterward.

⚡ High Availability (HA)

Designing systems so that services stay available with minimal downtime, even if hardware/software fails. Achieved through redundancy, load balancing, and multiple AZs/regions.
